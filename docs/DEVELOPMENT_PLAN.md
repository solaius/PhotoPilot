# PhotoPilot Development Plan

This document outlines the current state of the PhotoPilot project, what has been implemented, and what needs to be done next.

## Current State

We have set up the basic project structure for both the frontend and backend components of the PhotoPilot application. The project follows a modern architecture with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend.

### Implemented Features

#### Backend
- Basic Express server setup
- MongoDB models for User, Project, and MediaAsset
- Authentication routes and controllers (register, login, get profile)
- Project routes and controllers (CRUD operations)
- Media asset routes and controllers (CRUD operations)
- Basic middleware for authentication and authorization

#### Frontend
- React application setup with React Router
- Basic pages (Home, Login, Register, Dashboard, ProjectDetails, NotFound)
- Basic components (Header, Footer, PrivateRoute)
- API service for making requests to the backend
- Basic styling with CSS

#### Documentation
- API documentation
- README with setup instructions
- Development plan

#### DevOps
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- Environment configuration (.env files)
- Git configuration (.gitignore)

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Completion
- Set up MongoDB Atlas for database hosting
- Set up Redis for caching and real-time pub/sub
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Add logging and monitoring

### Phase 2: User Authentication & Access Control
- Implement OAuth2 integration for cloud storage providers (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive)
- Develop secure token storage with encryption at rest
- Implement token refresh flows
- Enhance role-based access control (RBAC) within projects

### Phase 3: Photo Management & Sorting
- Implement cloud storage API integrations
- Develop file listing and metadata synchronization
- Build sorting functionality (good, change, delete)
- Implement automatic subfolder creation

### Phase 4: AI Integrations
- Set up BLIP-2 microservice for image captioning
- Integrate GPT-4 Turbo for content generation
- Implement fallback options for AI services
- Create UI for triggering AI analysis and editing results

### Phase 5: Social Media Publishing
- Implement social media API integrations (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook)
- Build multi-platform publishing functionality
- Implement archiving of published content
- Add scheduling capabilities

### Phase 6: Real-Time Collaboration
- Set up Socket.io for real-time updates
- Integrate Redis as a pub/sub backplane
- Implement real-time notifications for sorting, commenting, and updates
- Add presence indicators and activity feeds

### Phase 7: Testing & QA
- Write unit tests for backend and frontend
- Implement integration tests
- Set up end-to-end testing
- Perform load and performance testing

### Phase 8: Deployment & Post-launch
- Deploy to Heroku (or alternative platform)
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Implement analytics
- Gather user feedback and iterate

## Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | 1-2 weeks | None |
| Phase 2 | 2-3 weeks | Phase 1 |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 weeks | Phase 2 |
| Phase 4 | 3-4 weeks | Phase 3 |
| Phase 5 | 2-3 weeks | Phase 3 |
| Phase 6 | 2-3 weeks | Phase 3 |
| Phase 7 | 2-3 weeks | Phases 1-6 |
| Phase 8 | 1-2 weeks | Phase 7 |

## Resources Needed

- MongoDB Atlas account
- Redis Cloud account
- Heroku account (or alternative hosting)
- OAuth credentials for cloud storage providers
- OAuth credentials for social media platforms
- OpenAI API key for GPT-4 Turbo
- GPU resources for BLIP-2 deployment

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI service costs | Implement caching and batch processing, monitor usage |
| Social media API rate limits | Implement queuing and rate limiting, provide clear feedback to users |
| Real-time collaboration conflicts | Implement conflict resolution mechanisms, use optimistic UI updates |
| Cloud storage API changes | Design adaptable interfaces, monitor for changes, implement fallbacks |
| Performance issues with large photo libraries | Implement pagination, lazy loading, and efficient caching |
