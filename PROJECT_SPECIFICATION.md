### 2. Functional Requirements

#### A. Features and Capabilities

1. **Photo Management & Sorting**
   - **Functionality:**  
     - Retrieve photos from multiple cloud storage providers.
     - Categorize each photo as “Good,” “Change,” or “Delete.”
     - Create subfolders (good, change, delete, archive) automatically within the source directory.
   - **User Stories / Use Cases:**  
     - As a photographer, I want to quickly review my images and classify them so that I can focus on the best ones for publication.
     - As a team member, I need to see real-time sorting decisions to collaborate efficiently.
   - **Roles and Permissions:**  
     - Editors: Can sort and modify images (including reordering, commenting, and bulk actions).
     - Viewers: Can see sorting decisions in real time without editing permissions.
   - **Flow / Interaction Diagram (Pseudocode Example):**  
     ```python
     def sort_photo(photo, decision):
         if decision == 'good':
             move_to(f"{project_path}/good/{photo}")
         elif decision == 'change':
             move_to(f"{project_path}/change/{photo}")
         else:
             flag_for_deletion(photo)
     ```

2. **AI-Powered Publication Preparation**
   - **Functionality:**  
     - On-demand image analysis using BLIP-2 to generate image descriptions.
     - Option for manual input or override of image descriptions.
     - Use AI (preferably GPT-4 Turbo) to generate social media post components (title, caption, hashtags).
   - **User Stories / Use Cases:**  
     - As a photographer, I want to have high-quality captions generated for my images so I can post them quickly.
     - As a user, I can edit or regenerate AI-generated content if needed.
   - **Metadata Structure Example:**  
     ```json
     {
       "post_content": {
         "title": "AI-generated title",
         "caption": "3-sentence description",
         "hashtags": ["#photography", "#nature"]
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Social Media Publishing**
   - **Functionality:**  
     - Publish selected images to multiple platforms (Instagram, X/Twitter, Facebook).
     - Enforce platform-specific constraints (e.g., Instagram’s business account requirement, rate limits).
     - Archive published photos (e.g., `/archive/{year}-{month}/published_photos/`).
   - **User Stories / Use Cases:**  
     - As a photographer, I want to select multiple platforms to post my content simultaneously.
     - As an admin, I want to be alerted if any platform’s rate limit is reached so that I can manage posting schedules.
   - **Roles and Permissions:**  
     - Only authorized users can trigger posts; view-only users can monitor post status.

4. **Collaboration & Real-Time Updates**
   - **Functionality:**  
     - Support real-time collaboration on photo sorting and commenting.
     - Use WebSockets (or similar) with a pub/sub backplane (e.g., Redis) to broadcast changes.
   - **User Stories / Use Cases:**  
     - As a collaborator, I want to see updates as other team members re-sort or annotate photos.
     - As a project manager, I want role-based controls ensuring that only authorized users can modify content.

#### B. Additional Clarification Requirements

- **Token Security and OAuth Verification:**  
  - Ensure secure storage of OAuth tokens with encryption at rest.
  - Handle multiple OAuth providers with dedicated callback endpoints and unified user experience.
- **Error Handling & Fallbacks:**  
  - If AI image description generation fails (BLIP-2 or GPT-4 Turbo), allow manual input.
  - Implement exponential backoff and retries for third-party API failures.

### 5. Data and Storage

#### A. Data Models / Schema

- **Projects Collection:**  
  - Fields: `name`, `cloud_path`, `owner`, `collaborators` (with roles), etc.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Wedding Shoot 2024",
      "cloud_path": "/wedding_shoot_2024",
      "owner": "user123",
      "collaborators": [
          { "userId": "user456", "role": "editor" },
          { "userId": "user789", "role": "viewer" }
      ]
    }
    ```
- **MediaAssets Collection:**  
  - Fields: `projectId`, `filename`, `status` (good, change, delete), `metadata` (AI description, custom text, social post details), `orderIndex`, etc.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "projectId": "project123",
      "filename": "IMG_001.jpg",
      "status": "good",
      "metadata": {

          ]
      },
      "orderIndex": 1
    }
    ```

#### B. Storage and Access Strategies

- **Cloud File Handling:**  
  - Store image files in user-designated cloud storage.  
  - Maintain file metadata and links in MongoDB.
- **Backup and Data Recovery:**

### 6. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:**  
  - Test individual functions (e.g., sorting logic, API integrations).
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Verify interactions between microservices (cloud API, AI services, social media APIs).
- **End-to-End Testing:**  
  - Use tools like Cypress or Selenium to simulate user workflows from login through publishing.
- **Usability Testing:**  
  - Conduct sessions with target users to assess UI/UX and workflow efficiency.
- **Load/Performance Testing:**  
  - Stress-test API endpoints, real-time messaging, and AI processing under expected load.
